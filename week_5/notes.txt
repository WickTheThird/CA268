# Here I shall test data structures 

#1 Queues...

#  A queue is defined as a linear data structure
#  which is open on both ends...
#  The operations are based on the first in first out princeple (FIFO)
#  We define a queue to be a list in which all the new additions are made at one end
#  The element which is first pushed onto the queue will be the first on in which 
#  operations are performed
#  
#  The queue works like the first came fist served princeple

#2 Stacks

A stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order
in which the order of the operations are performed
The order os first in last out (FILO) or last in furst out (LIFO)

A life exalpe on how stacks work is plates...
You see you place playes on topn of each other
And the first one you take out of that stack is the last one you placed
on top of them all...
